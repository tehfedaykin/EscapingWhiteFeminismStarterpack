# EscapingWhiteFeminismStarterpack

Resources compiled to help educate and further diversity & inclusion. 

If you've caught yourself thinking any of the blockquotes in this readme, I hope you'll consider challenging your own point of view and being open to understanding the experiences of others. You may not AGREE with everything said by these individuals or those methods, but I believe taking time to understand the things said and the methods used is a step in the direction of better understanding eachother and practicing challenging our own assumptions and thought patterns is key to growth. 

> "I already have a lot on my plate and work my ass off in this industry. You're asking me to do MORE?"

Yes, but you can start small. A really powerful way to change your perspective and recieve information you might not get otherwise is simply by changing your environment. This starter pack is a way to start making changes in your life to move towards self-education and reducing harmful impact on the most vunerable members of your community.

## At-A-Glance-Glossary

If you're new to some of the conversations and subjects listed in this repo, I wanted to share a few words, phrases and acronyms you may not be aware of.

### White Feminism: 

Describes feminist theories that focus on the struggles of white women without addressing distinct forms of oppression faced by ethnic minority women and women lacking other privileges. 

### Intersectional Feminism

A branch of feminism asserting that all aspects of social and political identities (gender, race, class, sexuality, disability, etc.) discrimination overlap (or "intersect").

(What does Intersectional Feminism Actually Mean)[https://iwda.org.au/what-does-intersectional-feminism-actually-mean/]

### Gaslighting

Manipulating someone by psychological means into questioning their own sanity. This often includes telling the person they are too emotional, imaganing things, or misinterpruting a situation.

(You’re Probably Just Imagining It: On Gaslighting & Startup Culture)[https://medium.com/@ruemcclammyhand/youre-probably-just-imagining-it-the-effects-of-gaslighting-on-marginalized-tech-workers-b45cd6a06841]

### Tone policing

> "I think people are too dramatic and everyone loves outrage and cancel culture so they make mountains out of molehills"

Tone Policing is a personal attack and antidebate tactic based on criticizing a person for expressing emotion. Tone policing detracts from the validity of a statement by attacking the tone in which it was presented rather than the message itself.

(Racism 101: Tone Policing)[https://medium.com/@tessintrovert/racism-101-tone-policing-92481c044b6a]

### Emotional Labor

A term coined by the sociologist Arlie Hochschild to describe the hidden emotional work service industry workers are expected to perform to positively influence the experience of a customer or colleague. In other words, the service worker must constantly manage their emotions—either by suppressing them, showing them, or redefining them—to achieve the results they want and to get the job done.

This is important to call out because a common response by white people upon learning about deepy embedded systemic racism and the harm it causes is to ask "what can I do to help?". While this seems innocent, it's putting the emotional labor on those already opressed to explain things to you, the priviledged white person, for what may be their millionth time, and it's exhausting. Use the resources in this repo to find more answers for yourself on how to begin to dismantle white supremecy without putting additional work on those already suffering.

)[https://www.portlandoregon.gov/article/686010]

### URM

Under-represented minority

## High Level Concepts

### Intent vs. impact

Intent does not erase impact. Just because someone did not have nefarious intentions does not mean their impact did not cause serious damage.

(Understanding Intent vs Impact)[https://shegeeksout.com/understanding-intent-vs-impact/]

### Diversity vs. Inclusion

Diversity is the "what"; inclusion is the "how." Diversity focuses on the makeup of your workforce — demographics such as gender, race/ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, veteran status, just to name a few, and inclusion is a measure of culture that enables diversity to thrive. - (Diversity And Inclusion: What's The Difference, And How Can We Ensure Both?)[https://www.adp.com/spark/articles/2019/03/diversity-and-inclusion-whats-the-difference-and-how-can-we-ensure-both.aspx]

The best analogy I've probably heard for this is: "Diversity is being invited to the party, inclusion is being asked to dance at the party."
